Fuzzy Logic Simulation (Greenhouse Control)

This program simulates main factors in greenhouse to ensure ideal conditions for growing plants. It is written in Java/Swing and uses self-made script language to change behaviour in real-time. The entire simulation is based on Mamdami model.

Main features

- Fully scripted simulation
- Start/Pause/Stop simulation
- Random input variables
- Whole bunch of statistics (for every variable, input and output factos) and history
